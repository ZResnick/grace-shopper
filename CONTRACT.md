Social Guidelines

1. Donâ€™t be assholes to each other! Remember to be patient and communicate with each other.

2. Notify all other team members prior to committing code. Let people know to pull code immediately after pushing and merging to master.

3. Pull master code at the beginning of the day and prior to pushing final commit of the day.

4. If you are stuck for approximately 1-2 hours without making any progress or just frustrated, consult the other programming pair for insight.

5. At the start of each work session, conduct a STAND UP session to allocate roles and work for the day. Reconvene at the end of the day just to summarize.

6. Only other team members can review your merge pull requests on Github.

7. Grace Shopper work will be conducted only during class hours unless agreed upon by team members on a case-by-case basis.
